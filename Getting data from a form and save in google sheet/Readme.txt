📌 Project Overview

This project is a simple automation workflow built with n8n that collects user data through an online form and automatically stores the submitted information in a Google Sheet.

⚙️ How It Works

Users fill out a registration form containing personal and educational information.

Once the form is submitted, the data is sent to an n8n workflow.

The workflow appends the submitted data as a new row in a connected Google Sheet.
