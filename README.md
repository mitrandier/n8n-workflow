# n8n-daily-workflow



Daily Test & Practice Workflows Repository

This repository is used to store daily test and practice workflows.

It does not include any APIs, credentials, or additional configuration.
The focus is purely on experimenting with and implementing workflows using different triggers and nodes.

The workflows here are created for:

Practice and learning purposes

Testing workflow logic

Exploring various trigger–node combinations

Prototyping workflow ideas without external dependencies

No production setup is intended.
Everything is kept minimal and isolated for experimentation only.
